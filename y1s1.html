                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>This module is a year-long and a CS/CU (pass/fail) module that covers 4 MCs. Since it's a year-long module, the workload is split into 2 semesters so it is technically worth 2 MCs per semester. From what I recall, it is mostly a fluff mod where you have tutorials that mainly discuss on ethics and the legal principles of being a pharmacist while understanding the different career paths for a Pharmacy student. In the first semester, the main bulk of the work includes a group presentation which requires an interview with an assigned NUS Pharmacy alumni in the different industries. Class tests were all open book during tutorials. A submission of a draft of the reflection essay was required at the end of the semester which the profs will provide feedback for.</p>
                    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>This module was really chill considering that it was year-long and pass/fail. Didn't have to touch the module or study for the class tests apart from interviewing the Pharmacy alumni and preparing for the presentations. The reflection essay only required about 300-400 words so it could be done within a day. The only downside is that it is year-long so the burden of the module is carried over to the next semester.</p>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Along with PR1150, this module is also a year-long module that covers 4 MCs. The difference between PR1151 and PR1150 is that PR1151 is graded. This module teaches on the basics of compounding and formulation of the final medicinal products such as capsules or solutions, as well as the fundamentals of interacting with patients as a future Pharmacist. The first semester focuses mainly on compounding.</p>
                    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>I would say, this was the module that I disliked the most in the semester. The amount of information thrown at you for the compounding practicals is immense and studying for the tests is no joke. A small mistake in the test could cost a failure as the profs want the students to simulate real life situations where no mistakes can be made when preparing and dispensing the drug products. Fair to say this makes sense considering that we do not want to kill patients in the real world, but I still struggled throughout the semester learning compounding. This module felt like a whole ass 4 MC module in one semester for a the amount of work required. It was a really painful module to take and I dreaded every tutorial session going to classes. The only thing that was keeping my sanity in check were my group mates during each tutorial.</p>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>The heaviest module of the semester, this module covers 8 MCs in one semester. It is mainly on the fundamentals of pharmacy which includes organic chemistry, anatomy and molecular biology. There were 4 hours of lectures every week and 3 hours of tutorial every alternate week. Organic chemistry was covered in the first half of the semester with the midterm testing the entirety of the topic. Organic chemistry was 50% JC H2 Chemistry while the rest of the 50% were new concepts that were not thought back then. Molecular biology was about 70% JC H2 Biology while the rest were new.</p>
                    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>I was drowned in the amount of workload that this module demands cosndering that it is 8 MCs, it definitely felt like an 8 MC module. It was really difficult to understand the prof, Dr. Tian Chong's accent so it was difficult to grasp the concepts during the lectures. Anatomy was a nightmare as there were so many different profs that conducted the lectures and it was crazy difficult to get used to their different accents. Some of the profs also seemed uninterested in teaching the topic which really killed the mood of learning. However, I really liked prof Chew and Dr. Wu Wei. They were in charged of teaching the final topic on molecular biology. Overall, if not for the workload and some profs/lecturers, this module is okay since a large part of it was taught back in JC (if you have taken H2 Chemistry and/or H2 biology).</p>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>This module teaches about the basics of collecting data, manipulating data and then presenting that data to an audience. Lectures are all pre-recorded and there is a 3 hour tutorial once every alternate week. There online quizzes once every week but they were open book and unlimited attempts. The questions for each quiz were all taken from the lecture notes given at the start of the semester. The midterms consisted of a 10 question MCQ and the finals was 15 MCQs.</p>
                    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>I feel that this is quite a simple module as it is mainly common sense and logic. The TA that taught my tutorials were one of the best TAs that I had. I mistook him as a prof due to the way he engages the class. 8am tutorials did not feel like a burden due to the TA. Group project is okay as long as you get good group mates. It was really quite simple where they mainly require manipulation of data and plotting of graphs using excel or R Studio.</p>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>This module is a CS/CU (pass/fail) module that covers 4 MCs. This module is also a fluff mod where you will learn the different factors that affect the health of an individual. 3 hour lecture-tutorials were held once every week on zoom so the only downside is that you will have to wake up at 8am every morning to attend them online. They also do not seem to take attendance so you could technically skip them but you will be dragging your groupmates down as there will be group work every session and worse if your group is called upon to answer questions. You may also miss out on important instructions for the group assignments. There are two main essay assignments to be submitted at different parts of the semester.</p>
                    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>Overall another chill module. The main bulk of the work would be the two essay assignments and the group assigments. However, since it is a pass/fail mod, you could technically not bother and do the bare minimum. The two individual assignments had a peer evaluation segment where each student will be assigned 6 other students to rank their work. It was quite nail-biting to see the rankings that I was given by 6 other students and the range of rankings really varied from 1-6. The essay assignments took quite a bit of time and effort to write them out since I was hoping for a good peer evaluation but now that I look back at it, it turns out that there was really no need to work so hard on them since it was a pass/fail mod. Remember guys, think wisely, all you need to do is pass.</p>
