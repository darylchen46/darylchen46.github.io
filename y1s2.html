                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>This module is a year-long and a CS/CU (pass/fail) module that covers 4 MCs. Since it's a year-long module, the workload is split into 2 semesters so it is technically worth 2 MCs per semester. From what I recall, it is mostly a fluff mod where you have tutorials that mainly discuss on ethics and the legal principles of being a pharmacist while understanding the different career paths for a Pharmacy student. In the first semester, the main bulk of the work includes a group presentation which requires an interview with an assigned NUS Pharmacy alumni in the different industries. Class tests were all open book during tutorials. A submission of a draft of the reflection essay was required at the end of the semester which the profs will provide feedback for.</p>
                    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>This module was really chill considering that it was year-long and pass/fail. Didn't have to touch the module or study for the class tests apart from interviewing the Pharmacy alumni and preparing for the presentations. The reflection essay only required about 300-400 words so it could be done within a day. The only downside is that it is year-long so the burden of the module is carried over to the next semester.</p>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Along with PR1150, this module is also a year-long module that covers 4 MCs. The difference between PR1151 and PR1150 is that PR1151 is graded. This module teaches on the basics of compounding and formulation of the final medicinal products such as capsules or solutions, as well as the fundamentals of interacting with patients as a future Pharmacist. The first semester focuses mainly on compounding.</p>
                    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>I would say, this was the module that I disliked the most in the semester. The amount of information thrown at you for the compounding practicals is immense and studying for the tests is no joke. A small mistake in the test could cost a failure as the profs want the students to simulate real life situations where no mistakes can be made when preparing and dispensing the drug products. Fair to say this makes sense considering that we do not want to kill patients in the real world, but I still struggled throughout the semester learning compounding. This module felt like a whole ass 4 MC module in one semester for a the amount of work required. It was a really painful module to take and I dreaded every tutorial session going to classes. The only thing that was keeping my sanity in check were my group mates during each tutorial.</p>
